#21. Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists
# Given heads of 2 sorted linked lists, list 1 and 2,
# Merge 2 lists into one sorted list. List made by splicing together nodes at first 2 lists.
# Return head of merged linked list

# Input: A = [5,10,15] , B = [2,3,20]
# Output: final = [2,3,5,10,15,20]

# Definition for singly-linked list.
